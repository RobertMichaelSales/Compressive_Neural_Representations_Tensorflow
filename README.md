# Compressive Neural Representations (Tensorflow)

A re-implemented and extended version of the original code from "Compressive Neural Representations" repository ([click here](https://github.com/matthewberger/neurcomp)). This, the newer version, is written using the Tensorflow machine learning library. 

Original Authors: [Yuzhe Lu](), [Kairong Jiang](), [Joshua A. Levine](https://jalevine.bitbucket.io/), [Matthew Berger](https://matthewberger.github.io/).
